### Docker & Docker-Compose

![Docker & Docker-Compose](https://github.com/perestr3lo/giropops-senhas/assets/60358650/5b8167ef-3a96-4b7a-a631-38bb876eb40a)

Docker and Docker-Compose are essential tools for packaging and orchestrating applications and their dependencies in containers, ensuring portability, consistency, and ease of deployment across different environments.

### Aqua Trivy

![Aqua Trivy](https://github.com/perestr3lo/giropops-senhas/assets/60358650/5e8856e9-2a5c-47e5-bfeb-a34671845b32)

Aqua Trivy is an open-source security tool that automates the detection of vulnerabilities in Docker and OCI container images, providing security and easy integration into CI/CD pipelines.

### Chainguard

![Chainguard](https://github.com/perestr3lo/giropops-senhas/assets/60358650/3be9c340-f268-4f29-8f56-408cf481abc3)

Chainguard is an approach to building container images using the "Distroless" philosophy, minimizing the size and attack surface of images, ensuring a secure and functional environment for running applications.

### Cosign

![Cosign](https://github.com/perestr3lo/giropops-senhas/assets/60358650/d63c7a73-7a14-4255-ae2f-bbd01cdf70f5)

Cosign is a container image signing tool that ensures the authenticity, integrity, and security of images before they are deployed in production environments.
